This week we are happy to announce our keynote for RustFest! We also exhausted our ticket sales, and explored the possibility of having childcare for the event.

## Keynote

This year for RustFest we're happy to welcome Alex Crichton to hold the stage. Alex is a member of the Rust Core Team who has worked at Mozilla on Rust for the past four years. He is also a member of the Tokio Core Team, one of the primary authors of Cargo, helps maintain the standard library, and likes to ensure that engine of Rust never stops.

So what will he teach us about?

> Async I/O has forever been a hot topic of discussion in Rust, but over the past year we’ve seen some significant advances in this domain with the futures crate an the Tokio project. We’ll start off by taking a look at where we are today with the async I/O ecosystem in Rust, highlighting a number of the features we’ve added in both the libraries and the language over the past year. We’ll then take a deep dive into Tokio itself and learn how it’s just so darn fast and capitalizes on some of Rust’s greatest strengths.

## Childcare?

We may have found a childcare provider for the duration of the conference. Before we go ahead and book we'd like to know if this service would be used. If you're attending the conference and would be interested in using a childcare service organized by the conference please send us an email at [team@rustfest.eu](mailto:team@rustfest.eu).

## Student Tickets Exhausted

This week we ran out of our allocated suppply of student tickets. This is both amazing and awful. It's amazing because it means we have lots of fantastic students to welcome to the conference. It's awful because it means we can't offer more tickets at this time. We can't wait to meet all of our studious attendees in Zürich!
